      <description>Hello! In this blog post I am going to be showing an example of how to implement the Maybe Monad in Typescript. It seems tremendously common for anyone learning functional programming to write their own version of an &amp;ldquo;Explaining Monads&amp;rdquo; blog post. I am glad to keep up the tradition.&#xA;Why worry about a Maybe type in the first place? Good question! The day to day work of a web developer requires handling all kinds of values that may, or may not exist.</description>

      <description>What is the prototype chain? How do we define objects in JavaScript?&#xA;Part of being a good developer is modularization. Splitting code apart and reusing functionality is key to writing solid maintainable code. One of the tools developers use to split code apart is Classes. In fact Classes are the main way programmers are taught to segment their code. This practice is so popular that many modern programming languages adhere to what’s called the Object Oriented Paradigm.</description>

      <description>Docker is a wildly successful solution to a common problem in the computing world.&#xA;But it works on my machine…&#xA;By packaging applications into Docker containers companies can assure that their solutions are going to work on any machine. Using containers lowers the cost and difficulty of deploying software. Containers are portable, easy to use (for the most part), and stable. It’s no surprise that Docker has been, and most likely will continue to be, gaining considerable support.</description>

      <description>When should you use Redux in a React project?&#xA;When using React, a state management library like Redux isn&amp;rsquo;t always necessary. Out of the box React provides a few solutions for managing state. Therefore, not every React project requires Redux. So, when should Redux be used? The main indicator of whether Redux is necessary is how complex the data flow in a project is.&#xA;State can be passed down</description>
